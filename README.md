# Reflection

The experience of assembling a PC by ourselves with the guidance of technical staff was a new and exciting one for us. We were able to learn all the steps involved in assembling a PC, from identifying the various components to putting them all together in the correct order. After we assembled the PC, we took a quiz that helped us to be more familiar with the steps and the components inside the PC. This hands-on experience was interesting and enjoyable.
